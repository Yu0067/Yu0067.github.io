<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="image/my picture.jpg" alt="Portait">
</header>
<p>My name is Deng Yu-Jyuan, I’m an international student from Taiwan. 
    <br>I am currently in my first year of Interactive Media Design program in Algonquin College. 
    <br>I like digital art and music. Now my remote job is to do graphic design for a clothing brand.
    <br><strong>“Work hard and play hard”</strong>is my motivational quote.
    <br>I hope I can burn enthusiasm at work and enjoy life appropriately.
    <br>I applied for the Interactive Media Design program in Algonquin college because I wanted to improve my skills and English ability.
    <br>It’s a special experience for me to be able to take classes online now. Although online classes can be borderless,
    <br>I am also looking forward to coming to Canada next year.</p>
